# a new config file will be created.

# Don't hesitate to create issues and pull-requests.


## primary_list
# Defines what list (either whitelist or blacklist) has the priority.
#
# For example: if 'blacklist' is set, the blacklist will overwrite
# the whitelist. It'll block the connection to a particular host listed in the
# blacklist even if it's allowed in the whitelist.
#
# Possible values: whitelist, blacklist
# Default value: blacklist

primary_list=blacklist


## use_partial_matching
# Defines whether the WHITELIST includes sub-domains or not.
#
# For example: You whitelisted the domain wholesome-ads.com, if the value
# is set to 'true' all it's sub-domains like annoying.wholesome-ads.com will be
# also allowed. To disable this set the value to 'false'.
#
# Note: if you set primary_list to blacklist you still can block it's
# specific sub-domains or top-level domain in the blacklist.
#
# Possible values: true, false
# Default value: true

use_partial_matching=true


## ignore_download_error
# If set to false, it'll only apply the hosts file if all hosts sources
# could be reached.
#
# For example: You have two host sources but one is not responding, to not
# lose the already installed domains from the failing source, the script
# won't continue if it was set to 'false'.
#
# Possible values: true, false
# Default value: false

ignore_download_error=false


## http_proxy, https_proxy
# Specify what proxy server should be used when fetching the ad-domains.
# Adsorber will prioritize the root users environment variables of 'http_proxy'
# and 'https_proxy' over the ones specified here.
#
# Please note that your ordinary user 'http(s)_proxy' environmental variables won't affect Adsorber
# as it doesn't run as your user but as root.
#
# Possible value: address:port (e.g proxy:8080, 127.0.0.1:9050)
# Default value: Null (not set)
#
# If a proxy server requires authentication, set the proxy variables as follows:
# http_proxy=http://USER:PASSWORD@PROXY_SERVER:PORT
# https_proxy=https://USER:PASSWORD@PROXY_SERVER:PORT
#
# Special Characters: If your password contains special characters,
# you must replace them with ASCII codes, for example the sign @ must
# be replaced by the %40 code, e.g. p@ssword = p%40ssword.

http_proxy=
https_proxy=


## hosts_file_path
# hosts_file_path is used to set the path to the systems hosts file.
# Change if your system uses a different file or path.
#
# Default value: /etc/hosts

hosts_file_path=./hosts


## hosts_file_backup_path
# Defines the backup location of the original hosts file created by the operating system.
# If no backup was created you can do this by running 'adsorber setup'.
#
# Default value: /etc/hosts.original

hosts_file_backup_path=./hosts.original


## hosts_file_previous_enable, hosts_file_previous_path
# Set if the previous applied ad-domains should be backed-up before applying
# a new version. To return back to the previous hosts run 'adsorber revert'.
#
# This option is useful if you want to rollback to the last applied version of ad-domains.
# If for example the current list has less or no ad-domains.
#
# Possible values for 'hosts_file_previous_enable': true, false
# Default value for 'hosts_file_previous_enable': true

hosts_file_previous_enable=true


## systemd_dir_path
# This defines the directory in which we'll place the systemd files.
# Used to create a scheduler which supplies the hosts file regulary with
# new ad-domains. Only change if your system has an other path.
#
# Note: if you don't have systemd you can leave this setting by its default value.
# Use in this case cronjob instead.
#
# Default value: /etc/systemd/system/

systemd_dir_path=/etc/systemd/system/
